# Converting a Colored Image into Black and White using OpenCV
Here I have 2 programs.
## 1st Program
--------------
### Input=jg.jpg
### output=jgbw.jpg
---------------
## 2nd Program
--------------
### Input=CMB.jpg,jg.jpg
### output=CBW.jpg,jg2.jpg

Here we can see a significant difference in output.2nd program is way better than 1st program.1st program gives Binary Image as output whereas 2nd program gives Black and White Picture.
